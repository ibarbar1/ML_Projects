## 📂 Projects

### 🍷 Wine Quality Prediction
**Type:** Binary Classification  
**Algorithm:** Random Forest  
**Dataset:** UCI Red Wine Quality Dataset  

This project predicts whether a red wine is of **good** or **bad** quality based on its physicochemical properties such as acidity, alcohol, sulphates, and density.

### 🛰️ Rock vs Mine Prediction
**Type:** Binary Classification  
**Algorithm:** Logistic Regression
**Dataset:** Sonar Mines vs Rocks Dataset (UCI / Kaggle)

This project predicts whether an object detected by sonar signals is a rock or a mine based on 60 continuous frequency-based signal features. The model applies feature scaling and a Logistic Regression classifier to accurately distinguish between the two classes.
